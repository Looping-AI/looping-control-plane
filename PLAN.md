# PLAN.md — Looping AI Short-Term Planning

This plan describes the incremental path from the current codebase to the architecture described in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Instructions

Each Phase is broken down into separate Tasks, each a separate development effort (separate PRs). Phases and Tasks are ordered by dependency, not priority — some later Phases may start in parallel with earlier ones where there are no blockers.

Each Phase is assigned a unique, sequential ID. Once a Task is fully completed, the Task at position n-2 can be safely deleted, retaining one prior Task for context.

Here’s a cleaner, structured version with better flow:

Each Task (using decimal notation, e.g., 0.x, 1.x) should begin in short form. Before implementation, it must be expanded into long form, then executed and marked as complete by striking through its title (e.g., ~~### 0.1 – User Model~~).

Short form consists of a title and supporting bullet points only.

Long form must include at least the following sections:

- Goal
- Current State
- Desired State
- Source Steps
- Test Steps

Then other optional sections can be added that you think are relevant for that specific task.

NOTE: Plans are not documentation. They are temporary and will be discarded. If behavior changes later, there’s no need to update an already struck-through Task.

Previous, not implemented, phases have been archived to [PLAN.archive.md](docs/plans/PLAN.archive.md).
